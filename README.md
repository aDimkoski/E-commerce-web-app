# e-shop app
This e-shop application is a comprehensive platform that enables businesses to manage their online 
product inventory and transactions effectively. It provides a wide range of features, 
including product management, shopping cart, authorization, authentication, stripe payments, and price logic for different
quantities and users. 

The application supports user authentication and authorization, allowing businesses to restrict access to certain 
pages or features based on user roles. The authorization and authentication system also ensures secure user registration 
and login processes. It also provides a shopping cart feature that enables customers to add multiple products to their cart and checkout in 
one go. The cart functionality is also customizable, allowing businesses to set minimum and maximum order quantities and limit the number of items a customer 
can add to their cart. 

The e-shop application uses Stripe as its payment gateway, which enables secure online payments. Stripe provides a wide range of 
payment options, including credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets. The integration with Stripe also allows businesses to manage their 
payments and refunds efficiently. The application supports dynamic pricing, which allows businesses to set different prices for different quantities of products. 
This feature enables businesses to incentivize bulk purchases and offer discounts to customers who buy more products.
